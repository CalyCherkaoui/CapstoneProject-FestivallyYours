# **Microverse Html/Css Capstone Project**

## Creating a responsive web page with Bootstrap

## Description:

In this project I built a Web-page from scratch based on a given [UX design](https://www.behance.net/gallery/25563385/PatashuleKE) with HTML and CSS.

The web-page is responsive in 3 different screen sizes:

- Mobile version : up to 768px;
- Tablet version: up to 1024px;
- Desktop version: from 1024px.

## Built With:

- HTML & CSS
- SASS
- Verry little JavaScript code.

## Workflow:

1. I installed NPM and NodeJs
2. I set up the node-sass watcher with npm.
3. I created a Gitignore file and "gitignore"-ed the node-modules folder
4. In my branch, I created a "dist" folder where i have my pure HTML and CSS files , and a "scss" folder where I have my Scss modules files
5. In my Scss, I worked with modules that have been used in the main.scss. Those modules are:
   5.0. Setting up the Overall parameters, variables (typography, colors palette), functions and mixins in \_config.scss
   5.1. Setting up all the navigation styling in \_navigation.scss file
   5.2. Setting up all the forms styling in \_forms.scss file
   5.3. Setting up the animations used in the project in the \_animation.scss file
   5.4. Setting up the cards styling in the \_card.scss file
